# NoSQL Database

Repository for http://nosql-database.org

Currently all stuff is done statically and the markup has to be "optimized".

## Running the site

In newer revisions the CSS generation is done by compass.

With `gem install compass` and afterwards

* `cd Resources/Private/Sass/`
* `compass watch .`

the CSS is generated dynamically.

## Todo

* Cleanup markup
* Extract inline styles to external CSS
* Migrate to Jekyll
